sdesc: "Filename encoding conversion tool"
ldesc: "Convert a single filename, a directory tree or all files
on a filesystem to a different encoding. It only converts the
encoding of filenames, not files contents. A special feature of
convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks: the encoding of the
symlink's target will be converted if the symlink itself is being
converted."
